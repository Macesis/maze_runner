# maze_runner
Maze runner project for cpp_programming 1
no runtime UI yet, will be determined later 
# Includes:
__maze__ - basic maze class that can import maze from file or generate maze (start and end points need to be set manually)
__maze_solver__ - an interface for implementing the solver algorithms  
__empty_path_maze__ - a maze solver class that uses an empty path algorithm (something similar to post order traversal)  
__breadth_first_maze__ - a maze solver class that uses a Breadth-first search algorithm (something similar to post order traversal)
